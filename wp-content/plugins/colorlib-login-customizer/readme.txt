= How do I access the login page customizer? =

After activating the plugin, go to **Appearance → Customize** in your WordPress admin. You'll see a new section called "Custom Login Page Customizer" where you can customize your login page with live preview.

= Will this plugin work with my theme? =

Yes! Custom Login Page Customizer works independently of your theme. It only modifies the WordPress login page (wp-login.php), so it's compatible with any WordPress theme.

= Can I add my own logo to the login page? =

Absolutely. Go to the Logo section in the customizer to upload your custom logo. You can also adjust the logo width, height, and link URL. You can choose to display just the image, just text, or both.

= How do I change the login page background? =

In the customizer, navigate to the Background section. You can upload a custom background image or set a solid background color. There are also options for the form column background if you're using a multi-column layout.

= Is the plugin compatible with WordPress Multisite? =

Yes, Custom Login Page Customizer works with WordPress Multisite. You can customize the login page for your entire network or individual sites depending on your configuration.

= Will my customizations be lost if I update the plugin? =

No. All your customizations are saved in the WordPress database, separate from the plugin files. Your settings will be preserved through plugin updates.

= Can I add custom CSS to the login page? =

Yes, there's a Custom CSS section where you can add your own CSS code for advanced styling. This is perfect for fine-tuning specific elements or adding custom effects.

= How do I reset the login page to default? =

You can reset individual settings by clearing the values in the customizer. To completely reset all settings, you can deactivate and delete the plugin, then reinstall it.
